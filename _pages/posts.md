### 2023 CoRL conference

Two papers accepted at CoRL:
STOW: Discrete-Frame Segmentation and Tracking of Unseen Objects for Warehouse Picking Robots
DYNAMO-GRASP: DYNAMics-aware Optimization for GRASP Point Detection in Suction Grippers
Looking forward meeting you at the conference.

### 2023 RSS workshop

I am going to present our work "Towards robustly picking unseen objects from
densely packed shelves" at the Workshop on Perception and Manipulation
Challenges for Warehouse Automation - Robotics Science and Systems (RSS).

### 2023 UW

I am joining the [Robotic Manipulation in Densely Packed Containers](https://robotic-manipulation.sciencehub.uw.edu/) project at UW!

### 2023 Journal accepted

Our journal on the memory architecture got accepted. Checkout the [preprint](https://h2t.iar.kit.edu/pdf/Peller2023.pdf).

### 2022 Travel grant!

I received the KHYS reserach travel grant and will be visiting Dieter's RSE Lab
at the University of Washington (UW), Seattle. 

### 2022 IROS 

Our work on success and failure detection got accepted for IROS. The preprint can be found [here](https://h2t.iar.kit.edu/pdf/Hegemann2022.pdf)

### 2022 RA-L - Mobile manipulation

Our work on mobile manipulation got accepted at the journal RA-L. Here is the [video](http://) and our
