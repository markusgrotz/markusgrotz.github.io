title:  "Hello World!"
---

My name is Markus, a passionate Postdoctoral Researcher in Dieter's lab at
the University of Washington (UW).  My academic journey began at the Karlsruhe
Institute of Technology (KIT), where I worked alongside Tamim and his team,
diving into the fascinating world of advanced humanoid robots.

My research focuses on visual perception for grasping and manipulation tasks, a
niche that seamlessly blends theoretical concepts with practical applications
in robotics and AI.  What excites me most about robotics is its
interdisciplinary nature, integrating elements from computer science,
engineering, systems integration, and more to solve complex problems.

Currently, I am deeply involved in the [Robotic Manipulation in Densely Packed Containers](https://robotic-manipulation.sciencehub.uw.edu/) project. 
The project deals with automation for industrial warehouses with dense packing,
which  makes objects more difficult to distinguish visually and requires
manipulation to be sensitive to the arrangement of objects in the shelf itself.
Here, my work involves coordinating research efforts, managing schedules and
goals, and overseeing software architecture. 

When I'm not immersed  in robotics, I enjoy sailing, climbing, and dancing.
These activities help me maintain a balanced and creative perspective.

I'm always open to new collaborations and discussions about the future of
robotics and AI. Feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:<family_name> <at> uw <dot> edu)  to explore potential projects or simply to
exchange ideas about the fascinating world of robotics.
